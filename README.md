# Information
Forked from https://github.com/kkkgo/KMS_VL_ALL  
Original README can be found in ``README_Original.md``  

# Motive behind the fork
The goal of this fork was to fix the scripts in order for them to work on the latest versions of Windows 10.  
Running ``DoEverything.bat`` will set up Auto Renewal, change your system key to a Windows 10 Pro for Workstation edition and then activate Windows.
